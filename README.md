# 5V-UPS-with-turn-off-delay

This UPS board provides the load with some time to safely shut down and avoid data loss.

When the input power is down, the output is sustained by a single-cell 3.7V battery and a voltage booster.
The booster will be turned off after a delay to protect the battery from draining.
